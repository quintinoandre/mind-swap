## In this exercise you will implement a Street Library System.

### Street Libraries are library stands found in public places where you can borrow books for free.

### In our Street Library system there will be two kinds of academy.mindswap.libraries: a completely free one, and another where you can only borrow a book if you make a book donation first.

### You can only borrow books that exist in the library, but when you borrow, you have two choices:

1. You can borrow a book by its name. Example "I want to borrow Love Is A Dog From Hell".
2. You can borrow a book by its author. Example "I want to borrow a book by Charles Bukowski".

### Right now these two are the only kinds of academy.mindswap.libraries we own, but it's a good idea to write a program that will be ready to add any other kind of Street Library with minor code refactoring.

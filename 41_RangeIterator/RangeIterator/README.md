## RangeIterator is a class capable of iterating every integer between a minimum value and a max value.

## RangeIterator DOES NOT store the integers; it is only aware of the minimum (where it begins iterating), and maximum (where it ends).

## Min value is inclusive, meaning it should be printed.

## Max value is inclusive, meaning it should be printed.

## Check Main.java to get an example of how objects of the type RangeIterator should be used.

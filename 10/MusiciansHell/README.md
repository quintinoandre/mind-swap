# EXERCISE - THE MUSICIANS FEAST IV
## The party is coming to an end, and the last musicians are leaving the venue when the staff calls them to help clean up the place.
## No one wants to do it, so a plan takes form: they will all line up, and a staff member will think of a random number between 10 and 15 to give each artist. If the musician's name has more letters than the picked number, that musician gets chosen to help. The others are free to go.

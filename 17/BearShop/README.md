# BEAR SHOP EXERCISE

## THE SIMPLE BEAR

### Like all bears, it can talk.

### Every time it talks, it says "I love you".

### When its batteries are exhausted, it loses its ability to talk.

## THE CRANKY BEAR

### Like all bears, it can talk.

### Every time it talks, it says "I love you".

### When its batteries reach a lower than 50% energy level, it loses its ability to talk. However, it can still sing a sad song one time, if it hasn't before.

## THE DRUNK BEAR

### Like all bears, it can talk.

### Every time it talks, it says "I love you", but it has a 0.2% probability of falling asleep. When this happens, this bear loses its ability to talk, snoring instead.

## THE SHOP

### The shop creates one bear at the time, and never stores them. The created bears follow a pattern:

### If the number of bears created is even, it creates a Simple Bear.

### If the number of bears created is a multiple of 5, it creates a Cranky Bear.

### If it's neither, it creates a Drunk Bear.

### The shop can compare itself to another shop. The store with more bears created, wins.

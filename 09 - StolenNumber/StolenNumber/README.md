# EXERCISE - THE MUSICIANS FEAST III
## It's concert time!
### Ten of the invited musicians will perform a concert, and each was given a number, from 1 to 10. That number will define the order in which the musicians will perform.
### Madonna, however, wasn't invited to perform and isn't handling the rejection with grace. Once the musicians are all lined up, she takes a number out of the set. Figure out which number she took.

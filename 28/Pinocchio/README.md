# PINOCCHIO EXERCISE

## Create a class to represent Pinnochio, following the rules below:

1. If Pinocchio lies, his nose grows. Nose growth is proportional to the number of lies told.
2. If Pinocchio's nose reaches a certain size, his head explodes. It can be fixed, but Pinocchio loses his
   ability to become a real boy forever.
3. If Pinocchio's head explodes, he can't do anything else until we fix it.
4. Pinocchio can do good deeds to make up for his lies. Every good deed completed, shortens Pinocchio's nose
   proportionally.
5. If Pinocchio's nose reaches 1 unit of size and he manages to do two additional good deeds without telling more lies
   in between, Pinocchio becomes a real boy (assuming he still can).
6. If Pinocchio becomes a real boy, his nose size will remain the same forever.

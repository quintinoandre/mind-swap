# MORNING RADIO EXERCISE

## Create a Morning Radio class that complies to the following rules:

1. Depending on the weekday, it plays a different opening song
2. lays a maximum number of songs per day, before the emission is closed
3. Every time it plays two songs, it should take a commercial break
4. An emission can have one of two types of hosts: a music lover that just plays the songs; a talker that spends
   half the time talking, reducing the number of maximum songs to a half
5. An emission must be closed in order to change the type of host, and restarted in order to play more songs

## NOTE: Try to keep it simple!! :)

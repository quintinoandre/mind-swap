### Have you ever played The Sims?

### In this exercise, you are going to implement something similar, minus the graphics and interaction part.

### The main objective is to create a Sims character that needs to buy a house before it can do anything, or an Exception should be thrown.

### After the Sims character manages to get a house, it can use it to perform different actions.

### Examples include eating, sleeping, watching tv, working...

### A Sim can't own more than one house. If it tries to, an exception should be thrown.

### Performing an action means using a house division.

### Every time the Sim uses a house division, depending on the division it uses, the level of cleanliness of the house should decrease.

### Different rooms have different levels of dirtiness generation.

### If the house gets too dirty, the Sim can't do anything else before it calls the housekeeper. If it tries to, an exception should be thrown.

### The housekeeper needs to be payed a minimum amount of money before it can clean the house. If it's not, an exception should be thrown.

### If the Sims character eats something, it should go to the bathroom before it can do anything else. If it tries to, an exception should be thrown.

### When the Sim performs an action, depending on the action, the energy level should decrease. If it reaches 0, the Sim can't do anything else before it performs an action that increases the energy level (like sleeping, for example).

### If it tries to, an exception should be thrown.

### And that's it!

### Have fun :D
